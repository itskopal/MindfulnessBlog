        <p class="post-text">Happy New Year, dear friends!
            <br>
            I hope the start of 2023 has brought you a renewed feeling of optimism, hope, and peace. If not, I hope you find comfort in knowing that it’s normal to feel even more pressure at the beginning of the new year. Society advertises things like, New Year, New You, as if on December 31,  at midnight,  a switch is flipped and we are all of a sudden free from all of our worries and stresses.  Be gentle with yourself and remember no feeling is ever final; everything changes, eventually.
            <br><br>
            At the end of last year, I started to feel a different sense of excitement and positivity for the new year to come, for some reason, 2023 felt like it might have a different energy to it than what we have been experiencing since 2020.
            <br><br>
            I feel a great sense of momentum, equilibrium, alignment, and confidence; all things I’ve often hoped for and yearned for.
            <br><br>
            In order to maintain these feelings, and the desire to make this year all that I hope for it to be, I came up with some positive affirmations to reinforce my intention word (fun) and my goals for the calendar year ahead. I’ve been really loving my affirmation practice lately, there is so much power found in noticing your thoughts and choosing differently.
            <br><br>
            One thing I like to emphasize when talking about affirmations is that this tool isn’t meant to be bypassing of difficult emotions or trauma in life. I wholeheartedly believe in feeling uncomfortable feelings and processing difficult emotions in a healthy, safe way. For me, affirmations are the tool to keep my monkey mind (the thoughts that come for no reason) at bay.
            <br><br>
            Below are the six affirmations I’m using to usher in 2023, use them, tweak them, or create some of your own to help you feel your best in this new chapter of life
            <br><br>
            1. I am excited for each new day, every moment of my life contains infinite opportunities. <br>
            2. I fully trust the timing and process of my life. My path is my own and I love it. <br>
            3. I am always in the right place at the right time. <br>
            4. I am a magnet for all that I desire in life; what is for me will never pass me. <br>
            5. I love myself fully, I am my own best friend. <br>
            6. I am safe, loved, and supported, always.
