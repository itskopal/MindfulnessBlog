        <p class="post-text">Dear friends,
            <br>
            Life can feel fast paced and at times, overwhelming, but as I’ve gotten older, I’ve grown fond of the periods of my life where I can pause, reflect, and recenter myself.
            <br><br>
            One of my very favorite, and most rewarding aspects of living an aware and mindful life is the privilege of really learning, understanding, and honoring who I am, as a person in this large, crazy world. I do truly believe that we are all here for such incredible, unique purposes, and that, we really do ourselves a disservice when we don’t take the time and energy to cultivate a strong sense of self, and a loving relationship with that self.
            <br><br>
            Self-reflection and introspection is that tool that can help us tap in and cultivate that most important relationship in our lives, the one we have with ourselves.
            <br><br>
            For a large part of my life I felt a mistaken sense of identity. I used the external world as a mirror to create a false reflection all around me. I strived so hard to fit in, to be liked, and to be understood, but really what I was yearning for, was to fit in, like, and understand myself.
            <br><br>
            I have passionately made it my mission to release all the lies and false pretenses, to untangle the messy webs, and to peel back all the layers I surrounded myself with, in hopes of uncovering who I really am.
            <br><br>
            The road to self-discovery is long, in fact, it’s a life-long journey. And this is the truth that I want to share with you today.
            <br><br>
            I used to think that when I finally found myself, I would reach a holy destination and everything would magically fall into place. The truth of the matter is, we are never really found, but rather in a constant state of becoming and uncovering.
            <br><br>
            Not too long ago, I hit a brief moment of frustration on my path in cultivating my own strong sense of self, when I felt angry that I didn’t have all the answers, and I didn’t feel like I had it all together in the way that I thought that I should. And then, a massive light bulb when on, and I realized, that this is simply not how life works! It’s not possible to know everything, all the time. We are not meant to live a stagnant life, without change and evolution.
            <br><br>
            We get the privilege of having a front row seat to watch ourselves grow, learn, and become. We get to be the witnesses of our very own personal high’s and low’s, be the private audience of our own life’s story. And who doesn’t love a really good story?
            <br><br>
            The moment I stopped trying to label and figure myself out, and started acknowledging and honoring who I am in this moment, life began to feel more free, more colorful, and more exciting. Chasing the end goal feels heavy and unattainable. Satisfaction, grace, and gratitude for who I am and where I am now, feels so much lighter, satisfying, and more fun.
             <br><br>
            The journey to self-discovery is the greatest adventure you can undertake, and I encourage you all to make space for simple moments where you can feel the love, appreciation, and understanding of yourself; your unique beautiful soul. Don’t try to put yourself into boxes and find pre-conceived labels to match, please just remember that you are always blossoming and evolving, shedding and regenerating. You are perfectly beautiful this way.
            <br><br>
            <i>Remember, you are worthy of the time, love, and energy that you so freely give to others. Allow yourself the time to spend with yourself, getting to know yourself, and honoring who you are.</i>
