        <p class="post-text">The vows we make to one another on our wedding day is a promise to be faithful to one another.
            <br>
            We declare to each other and in front of our loved ones that we are in. We are there for the good, the bad, and the ugly.
            <br>
            We are each other’s people for life! It is such a beautiful and powerful pledge of commitment that we make to one another.
            <br>
            The covenant of marriage that God honors and desires us to remain faithful to whenever possible. Matthew 19:6 says it this way, “So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”
            <br>
            God desires those heartfelt and optimistic words we declare at the start of our marriage to remain true over the course of the life we spend with our partners.
            <br>
            God also knows this is not an easy task! Choosing to love the same person over years of new responsibilities, needs, interests, wishes, struggles, pains, and joys requires more than we have to give on our own strength.
            <br>
            We need Jesus to be able to faithfully love each other well. Let’s explore what God’s word says about remaining faithful to our marriage and some practical ways we can live this out in our daily lives together.
            <br>
            Here are 3 Scriptures about faithfulness:
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">1. Galatians 5:22-23 </h2>
        <p class="post-text"> <b><i> "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things, there is no law."</i></b>
            <br>
            God’s Spirit alive in us looks like living a life marked by the fruits of the Spirit. This is the evidence that we are followers of Jesus.
            <br>
            These are the things that set us apart from the world around us. That evidence includes being faithful to our relationships, commitments, believes, to God, and to our marriages.</p>
        <h2 class="post-text">2. 1 Corinthians 10:13</h2>
        <p class="post-text"><b><i>"No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation, he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it."</i></b>
            <br>
            We don’t have to be faithful through our own strength. God knows that we will be tempted, that life is filled with hardship, and that darkness seeks to entice us with the lie of forbidden pleasure. God encourages us but reminding us that HE IS FAITHFUL.</p>  
            <br>
            We can overcome the temptations that are common to this world because God’s power is at work in our lives. He gives us the strength we need to remain faithful to our commitments. 
        <h2 class="post-text">3. Proverbs 28:20</h2>
        <p class="post-text"><b><i>"A faithful man will abound with blessings, but whoever hastens to be rich will not go unpunished."</i></b>
            <br>
            Our faithfulness to living a righteous and committed life does not go unnoticed by God. He promises that our efforts will be blessed.
            <br>
            God is pleased when we choose to be faithful in our marriages.</p>
        
        <p class="post-text"><i>Marriage is a living thing. It requires that we tend to it, water it, feed it, nurture it, protect it from the elements of this world, and it only takes a short period of neglect for decay to become apparent to us. 
            <br>
            If we desire to be faithful to one another, then we have to make a daily choice to pour into our relationship. We have to create routines that communicate love, consideration, and make space for us to connect with each other.
            <br> 
            Being faithful to one another is a daily task but thankfully God promises to give us the strength we need to help our marriages thrive. </i></p>
